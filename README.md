# Next Word Predictor

## Overview

This project implements a simple next word predictor using PyTorch. It serves as a reintroduction to PyTorch and demonstrates basic natural language processing (NLP) concepts.

## Purpose

The main goals of this project are:

1. To refresh PyTorch skills
2. To create a basic language model for next word prediction
3. To understand the fundamentals of text processing and sequence modeling

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ivanrj7j/pytorch-next-word.git
   cd next-word-predictor
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Model Architecture

The project uses a simple recurrent neural network (RNN) implemented in PyTorch. The architecture consists of:

- An embedding layer
- An LSTM layer
- A fully connected output layer
